    "Each week, Professor Van Hentenryck introduces a set of algorithmic approaches to combinatorial optimization problems. Then, the weekly programming assignment is an NP-hard optimization problem, along with a set of several different input data files. The different data files are all valid inputs to the same problem, but of different sizes (i.e. it's much harder to find an optimal solution for a given NP-hard problem on a large dataset than a small one)\n",

    "It's always going to be pretty easy to get a pretty good solution for the smaller data files. To get an optimal solution to the smaller data files, you might have to be a bit more clever. To get a good solution to the larger data files, it's gonna be a bit more work. And to do really well, you need to find optimal (or at least close to optimal) solutions for even the largest data files. "
