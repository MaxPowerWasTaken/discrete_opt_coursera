We also have a solution for the simplest, sorta atomic level of subproblem. However, recursion is top-down, in that you start with your 'real problem', break it into subproblems, break those subproblems into further subproblems, etc, all the way until you hit that atomic level that you have a solution for. DP, by contrast, is bottom up; it starts at the atomic level you have a pre-determined solution for, and uses the recurrence relations to keep building out a solution one level higher, then another level higher, until you have the answer for the level you need.\n",

    "The recurrence relations for the DP solution of the Knapsack problem is as follows:\n",

    "Let's define `O(k,j)` as the optimal value we can get for a knapsack of capacity `k` and with `j` items to consider. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $O(k,0) = 0$ for all $k$, because we get no value from no items.\n",
    "- Now assume, while trying to solve for any $O(k,j)$, we had the solution to $O(k, j-1)$. Then we would just need to find the increase in our optimal value for adding that `j`th item...\n",

The DP lecture link above from this Discrete Opt course ([also here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization/lecture/wFFdN/knapsack-4-dynamic-programming)) is helpful, although I do think from about 7:00 on is much more intuitive and easier to follow than the first 7:00.
